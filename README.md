# icesat2
Scripts for download and rapid analysis of ICESat-2 data  
Based on Open-Source Python and Geospatial libraries

## Rapid Visualization
We have developed this set of Jupyter Notebooks based on open-source Python libraries. Our focus is on:
- Ease subsetting and request of ICESat-2 granules from NSIDC server
- Download using NSIDC API
- Parse the HDF files into common geospatial formats (eg. shapefile, csv)
- Quick but interactive visualization of data
